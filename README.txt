SUDOKU PUZZLE SOLVER

Description:
Simple java application which can solve 9x9 sudoku puzzles

Installation and use:
Same as anyother java program (the .java files are included).
Choose the size of your puzzle (only 9x9s are currently implemented) and enter 
in the contents of each cell. 

Other Notes:
Please don't give bad input. I haven't add too much error checking. 

Future Plans:
Upload a .jar
I would like to divide the cells so it looks more like a real sudoku puzzle.
Extend it to solve 4x4 and 16x16 puzzles. 
Make a web version (maybe a java applet)
Use handwriting recognition to let it parse sudoku puzzle files rather than
forcing the user to input every square.
